              This is to help you navigate the read page, if you don't want to read the text there is a video at the bottom you can watch (enjoy me rambling üòÄ)

                <strong>Read Page</strong> <small> (background is a lots of books)</small> is made of helper buttons (3), a Read Form and the Read Table.
            </h6>

              <p>
              <strong>The 3 helper buttons</strong> each one opens a modal element <small>(that takes up 50% of the page depending on which one you open, you already found the main helper, that opens down the page üëç)</small>
            <br/>
                The like button - opens on left 
                <br/>
                The dislike button -  opens on right
                <br/>
                These reveal lists, by seeing what I like and dislike may help with recommendations. 
                <br/>
                <br/>
                <strong><u>Read Form</u></strong> is in an accordion element, opening it reveals input fields (6).

                <li><strong>Book -</strong></li>
                In the Book input field, you can put the book that you recommend to me (Becky) to read.

                <li><strong>Author -</strong></li>
                In the Author input field, you can put the author of the book <small>(The author of the book may intrigue me)</small>

                <li><strong>Plot/Description -</strong></li> 
                In the Plot/Description input field you can put the description/plot of the book. <small>(You could write that yourself or take from the web)</small>

                <strong>Number Of Books</strong>
                </li>
                In the Number Of Books,if there are multiple in the collection then input how many are included.
                <small>(if only single then just put 1)</small>
              

              <li>
                  <strong>Connected With -</strong> 
              </li>
                  In the connected with put if the book is connected with anything - such as films, tv shows or books <small>(I am a little OCD and like to do things in order)</small>
               

                <li>
                  <strong>Recommended By -</strong> 
                </li>
                In the Recommended By input field you can put your name - who recommends it (maybe the book was recommended to you and you're passing it on and spreading the word) 
                <br/>
                <small>(If you could please put in brackets where you are from just as a referrence to me but you don't have to it would be nice for me to know where you've come here from).</small>
