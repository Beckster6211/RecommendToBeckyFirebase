                Food Form is in an accordion element, opening it reveals 3 input fields.
                {/* <ul> */}
                  <li>Food
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Recipe/Where
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Recommended By
                  </li>
                {/* </ul> */}
                  In the Food input field, you can put the food (or drink) item that you recommend to me (Becky) to try.
                  {/* </p>
                <p> */}
                <br/>
                  In the Recipe/Where input field you can put the restaurant/place that you can get the recommended food from. Or you could put the recipe in, either in the ingredients and steps to make it or paste a url to site or video. 
                  <br/>
                  <small> (If the recipe is a family one and you don't want to publicly share it I understand ü§´ you could put an email address with 'Contact me, I'm not giving away my families secrets'ü§ê).</small>
                {/* </p>
                <p> */}
                <br/>
                  In the Recommended By input field you can put your name - who recommends it (maybe the food item was recommended to you and you're passing it on and spreading the word) 
                  <br/>
                  <small>(If you could please put in brackets where you are from just as a referrence to me but you don't have to).</small>
                {/* </p>
                <p> */}
                <br/>
                  You can have a look through the table to get an idea of how to fill out the food form.
                  <br/>
                  There are two buttons to help you with what I like and dislike. The like opens an modal on the left side of the screen and the dislike opens on the right.
