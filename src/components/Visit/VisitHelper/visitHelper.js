              This is to help you navigate the visit page, if you don't want to read the text there is a video at the bottom you can watch (enjoy me rambling 😀)

                <strong>Visit Page</strong> <small> (background travel collage)</small> is made of helper buttons (3), a Visit Form and the Visit Table.
            </h6>

            <p>
            <strong>The 3 helper buttons</strong> each one opens a modal element <small>(that takes up 50% of the page depending on which one you open, you already found the main helper, that opens down the page 👍)</small>
            <br/>
                The like button - opens on left 
                <br/>
                The dislike button -  opens on right
                <br/>
                These reveal lists, by seeing what I like and dislike may help with recommendations. 
                <br/>
                <br/>
                <strong><u>Visit Form</u></strong> is in an accordion element, opening it reveals input fields (4).

                <li><strong>What -</strong></li>
                In the What input field, you can put what you recommend to me (Becky) to visit. 

                <li><strong>Where Specific -</strong></li>
                In the Where Specific input field, you can put the where the place that you recommend that I visit is.  <small>(Geographically where)</small>

                <li><strong>Why/Details -</strong></li> 
                In the Why/Details input field you can put the details or why should visit that place. <small>(You could write that yourself or take from the web)</small>

                <li>
                  <strong>Recommended By -</strong> 
                </li>
                In the Recommended By input field you can put your name - who recommends it (maybe the place was recommended to you and you're passing it on and spreading the word) 
                <br/>
                <small>(If you could please put in brackets where you are from just as a referrence to me but you don't have to it would be nice for me to know where you've come here from).</small>
            </p>

            <h6 className="visitHelperHeading">
                  You could always have a look through the table to get an idea of how to fill out the visit form 👀
              </h6>

              <p>
              <strong><u>Visit Table</u></strong>
                  <br/>

                  <li>
                    the <strong>what, where specific and why/details</strong><small> (inside textareas so they are scrollable)</small>
                    </li> 

                    <li>
                      <strong>
                    my opinion</strong>, a checkbox to show if I have visited ✔️, an emoji of what I think if I have visited - <small>(<strong>locked buttons for my use only</strong> to show the opinion of yes 😁, no 😫 and alright 😑)</small> and also what my opinion of it is <small>(if visited yet 🤔)</small> 
                    </li>

                    <li>
                    <strong>who recommends</strong> <small>(also in a textarea so is scrollable)</small> 
                    </li>

                    <li>
                      <strong>
                    delete</strong> <small>(the delete button I have left open to all, so if you add something wrong you can delete it but <strong>please be careful</strong> when deleting so don't erase others 🙂)</small>
                    </li>
