              This is to help you navigate the try page, if you don't want to read the text there is a video at the bottom you can watch (enjoy me rambling üòÄ)

                <strong>Try Page</strong> <small> (background try collage)</small> is made of helper buttons (3), a Try Form and the Try Table.
            </h6>

            <p>
            <strong>The 3 helper buttons</strong> each one opens a modal element <small>(that takes up 50% of the page depending on which one you open, you already found the main helper, that opens down the page üîΩ)</small>
            <br/>
            The like button - opens on left ‚óÄÔ∏è
                <br/>
                The dislike button -  opens on right ‚ñ∂Ô∏è
                <br/>
                These reveal lists, by seeing what I like and dislike may help with recommendations. 
                <br/>
                <br/>
                <strong><u>Try Form</u></strong> is in an accordion element, opening it reveals input fields (4).

                <li><strong>Try this -</strong></li>
                In the Try this input field, you can put what you recommend to me (Becky) to try. 

                <li><strong>Where Specific -</strong></li>
                In the Where Specific input field, you can put where the place that you recommend that I try this.  <small>(Geographically where)</small>

                <li><strong>Why -</strong></li> 
                In the Why input field you can put the details or why should try this. <small>(You could write that yourself or take from the web)</small>

                <li>
                  <strong>Recommended By -</strong> 
                </li>
                In the Recommended By input field you can put your name - who recommends it (maybe the activity was recommended to you and you're passing it on and spreading the word) 
                <br/>
                <small>(If you could please put in brackets where you are from just as a referrence to me but you don't have to it would be nice for me to know where you've come here from).</small>
            </p>

                  You could always have a look through the table to get an idea of how to fill out the try form üëÄ

                    the <strong>try this, where specific and why</strong><small> (inside textareas so they are scrollable)</small>

                      the<strong>the delete</strong> <small>(the delete button I have left open to all, so if you add something wrong you can easily delete it <strong> but please be careful</strong> when deleting so don't erase others üôÇ)</small>
