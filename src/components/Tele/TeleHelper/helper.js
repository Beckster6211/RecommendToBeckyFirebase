              This is to help you navigate the tele page, if you don't want to read the text there is a video at the bottom you can watch (enjoy me rambling üòÄ)
              <br/>
                <br/>
                <strong>Tele Page</strong> <small> (background is a lots of different televisions)</small> is made of helper buttons (3), a Tele Form and the Tele Table.
            </h6>
            <p>
            <strong>The 3 helper buttons</strong> each one opens a modal element <small>(that takes up 50% of the page depending on which one you open, you already found the main helper, that opens down the page üîΩ)</small>
            <br/>
                The like button - opens on left ‚óÄÔ∏è
                <br/>
                The dislike button -  opens on right ‚ñ∂Ô∏è
                <br/>
                These reveal lists, by seeing what I like and dislike may help with recommendations. 
                <br/>
                <br/>
                <strong><u>Tele Form</u></strong> is in an accordion element, opening it reveals input fields (5).

                <li><strong>Tv Show -</strong></li>
                In the Tv Show input field, you can put the tv series that you recommend to me (Becky) to watch.

                <li><strong>Plot/Description -</strong></li> 
                In the Plot/Description input field you can put the description/plot of the Tv series. <small>(You could write that yourself or take from the web)</small> You could put the url to a trailer if you like.

              <li>
                <strong>Number Of Series</strong>
                In the Number Of Series put the number of series that the show is made up of.
              </li>

                <li>
                  <strong>Connected With -</strong>
                  In the connected with put if the tv show is connected with anything - such as films, other tv shows or books <small>(I am a little OCD and like to watch things in order)</small>
                </li>

                <li><strong>Recommended By -</strong></li>
                In the Recommended By input field you can put your name - who recommends it (maybe the tv show was recommended to you and you're passing it on and spreading the word) 
                <br/>
                <small>(If you could please put in brackets where you are from just as a referrence to me but you don't have to, it would be nice for me to know where you've come here from).</small>
            </p>

            <h6 className="teleHelperHeading">
                  You could always have a look through the table to get an idea of how to fill out the tele form üëÄ
