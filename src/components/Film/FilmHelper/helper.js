              This is to help you navigate the film page, if you don't want to read the text there is a video at the bottom you can watch (enjoy me rambling üòÄ)

                <strong>Film Page</strong> <small> (background is clips from Disney films üòÅ)</small> is made of helper buttons (3), a Film Form and the Film Table.
            </h6>
            <p>
            <strong>The 3 helper buttons, </strong> each one opens a modal element <small>(that takes up 50% of the page depending on which one you open, you already found the main helper, that opens down the page üîΩ)</small> 
                <br/>
                The like button - opens on left ‚óÄÔ∏è
                <br/>
                The dislike button -  opens on right ‚ñ∂Ô∏è
                <br/>
                These reveal lists, by seeing what I like and dislike may help with recommendations. 
                <br/>
                <br/>
                <strong><u>Film Form</u></strong> is in an accordion element, opening it reveals input fields (4).

                <li><strong>Film -</strong></li>
                In the Film input field, you can put the film that you recommend to me (Becky) to watch.

                <li><strong>Plot/Description -</strong></li> 
                In the Plot/Description input field you can put the description/plot of the film. <small>(You could write that yourself or take from the web)</small> You could put the url to a trailer if you like.

                <li>
                  <strong>Connected With -</strong>
                  In the connected with input field put if the film is connected with anything - such as other films, maybe tv series or books <small>(I am a little OCD and like to watch things in order)</small>
                </li>

                <li><strong>Recommended By -</strong></li>
                In the Recommended By input field you can put your name - who recommends it (maybe the film was recommended to you and you're passing it on and spreading the word) 
                <br/>
                <small>(If you could please put in brackets where you are from just as a referrence to me but you don't have to, it would be nice for me to know where you've come here from).</small>
            </p>
            
            <h6 className="filmHelperHeading">
                  You could always have a look through the table to get an idea of how to fill out the film form üëÄ
